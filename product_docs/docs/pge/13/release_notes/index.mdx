### Migration

A dump/restore using [pg_dumpall](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/app-pg-dumpall.html) is required for those wishing to migrate data from any previous community PostgreSQL release.

### Changes


- Rebase to the REL_13_0 tag of the community PostgreSQL code base.

- Show a backtrace for PANIC messages by default even if guc is disabled

     Getting to know the stack trace for PANIC messages is handy for
     forensics. So show the backtrace for such messages regardless of if the
     pg2q.backtrace_on_internal_error configuration parameter is enabled or not.
    
- Provide a way to skip checking of NOT VALID constraints.

    While NOT VALID constraints are normally checked and enforced for new rows
    being inserted/updated into the database, we provide an optional facility to
    skip the checks. This is useful for apply workers which may choose to skip the
    check, either because the check is done on the origin or because the
    check is known to potentially produce an ERROR and user instead wants to rely
    on subsequent VALIDATE CONSTRAINT to catch violations.
    
- Add a table level option to control compression

    We now support a new table level option, compress_tuple_target, which can be
    set to decide when to trigger compression on a tuple. Prior to this, the
    toast_tuple_target (or the compile time default) was used to decide whether or
    not to compress a tuple. But this was detrimental when a tuple is large enough
    and has a good compression ratio, but not large enough to cross the toast
    threshold. We wouldn't compress such tuples, thus wasting a potentially good
    opportunity.
    
- COPY FREEZE: Check if all tuples in a given page of a given table are frozen and visible, without doing any extensive checks.

    We will typically do this when we are doing table insertions in
    TABLE_INSERT_FROZEN mode (e.g. COPY FREEZE). Since the relation is not
    visible to any other transactions when running in this mode, we usually
    expect the pages to contain only tuples with frozen-xmin and invalid-xmax.
    But in order to guard against the case when our own transaction may has
    inserted regular tuples, which are not marked frozen, in the table and for
    abundance of caution, we do this check additionally.
    
- Add 2ndQPostgres configuration parameters to limit max tuple size and max field size

    The new pg2q.max_tuple_size parameter restricts the maximum before-TOASTing size that
    may be written to a table. This is the total row width including the
    uncompressed width of all TOASTable VARLENA attributes.
