If you are upgrading a Debian-based system (or a compatible system such as Ubuntu), then you used a Debian package to install EDB Postgres Advanced Server. To perform a minor upgrade on these systems, use the `apt-get` package manager.

!!! Note
    This procedure only performs an upgrade between minor EPAS releases. To upgrade to a later major release, use the [`pg_upgrade` procedure](../major_upgrade/).

1.  To list the package updates that are available for your system, open a command line, assume root privileges, and run:

    ```shell
    apt-get install --simulate <package_name>
    ```

    Where `package_name` is the search term for which you want to list available updates. You can include wildcard values in the search to list multiple related packages with a single command. For example, use the following command to list all packages with names that start with `edb`:

    ```shell
    apt-get install --simulate edb*
    ```
    
1.  After you identify the package(s), update them:

    ```shell
    apt-get install <package_name>
    ```

    Where `package_name` is the name of the package you want to update. You can include wildcard values to update multiple related packages with a single command. For example, use the following command to update all packages with names that start with `edb`:

    ```shell
    apt-get update edb*
    ```

1.  The output asks for confirmation to install the packages: 

    ```console
    After this operation, <number> kB of additional disk space will be used.
    Do you want to continue? [Y/n] Y
    ```

1.  Confirm by entring the letter `Y` and pressing **Enter**. 

1.  Restart your server to complete the upgrade. 

For more information about using `apt-get` commands and options, enter `apt-get --help` at the command line.

!!! Important
    
If upgrading to version 15.4  or later, run `edb_sqlpatch`.

The command might respond that it has a number of patches needing to be applied, for example:

```console
* database edb
0 patches were previously applied to this database.
58 patches need to be applied to this database.
```

In this case, you need to run edb_sqlpatch to patch the system catalog:

```shell
edb_sqlpatch -af
```

For more information about using edb_sqlpatch commands and options, see [edb_sqlpatch](/tools/edb_sqlpatch/).
