description: Revise any unsupported Oracle data types and features.  
---

A limited number of Oracle data types and features aren't supported by EDB Transporter.

See the [Debezium documentation](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/2.2/connectors/oracle.html#oracle-data-type-mappings) for detailed comments on supported data types. 

Unsupported Oracle data types include:

- BFILE
- LONG
- LONG RAW
- RAW
- UROWID
- User-defined types (REF, Varrays, Nested Tables)
- ANY
- XML
- Spatial

Don't use EDB Transporter for replicating Oracle tables that contain BLOB, CLOB, or NCLOB columns that are expected to change. These types are supported for snapshots but are not captured in the streaming CDC replication.

`BINARY_FLOAT` and `BINARY_DOUBLE` types in Oracle that might contain `Nan`, `+INF`, and `-INF` values are not supported by EDB Transporter.
