This terminology is important to understand EDB Transporter functionality.

## Analytics Sync
PG AI Analytics Sync is a type of replication/migration supported by EDB Transporter. EPAS and Postgres source database snapshots are transformed into Delta Lake format in CSP Object Storage -- exposed as PG AI Managed Storage Locations.

## Apache Kafka
Apache Kafka is an open-source, distributed-event streaming platform used by thousands of companies for high-performance data pipelines, streaming analytics, data integration, and mission-critical applications.

## Change Data Capture (CDC)
CDC is a set of software design patterns used to determine and track the data that changed (the *deltas*) so that you can take action using the changed data.

## Debezium
Debezium is a Java-based open-source platform for CDC. Debezium is supported by the Red Hat community.

## Transporter Reader
The Reader uses Debezium to perform CDC operations on the source database and produce Kafka messages containing the change events.

## Transporter Writer
The Writer consumes CDC events from Kafka and applies them to the destination database. For migrations to the PG AI platform the Writer is run and managed by EDB.
